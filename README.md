# G4_Metric
R Scripts, Simulated Datasets, &amp; Figures From The G4 Manuscript

Each R script contains instructions on how to import a dataset, analyze it, and summarize the results. Simulated datasets mimic results from a MRMC study with two modalities ("Aided" & "Unaided") and one reader (this can also be seen as a reader-average score) across difference minority-class prevalence rates.
